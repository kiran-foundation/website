# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing laptop support form by implementing comprehensive client-side validation with error messages and toast notifications. The form currently has validation logic implemented but is not properly connected to the form submission flow. This enhancement will ensure all required fields are validated before submission, display appropriate error messages for each field, and show toast notifications to provide user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out the laptop support form, I want to see validation errors for empty required fields when I try to submit the form, so that I know which fields need to be completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any required field is empty THEN the system SHALL display an error message below the empty field(s)
2. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any required field is empty THEN the system SHALL show a toast notification indicating how many fields need to be filled
3. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any required field is empty THEN the system SHALL focus on the first empty field and scroll it into view
4. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any required field is empty THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user filling out the laptop support form, I want to see validation errors for incorrectly formatted fields when I try to submit the form, so that I can correct the data format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any field has invalid format THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message below the invalid field(s)
2. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any field has invalid format THEN the system SHALL show a toast notification indicating validation errors exist
3. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any field has invalid format THEN the system SHALL focus on the first invalid field and scroll it into view
4. WHEN the user clicks the submit button AND any field has invalid format THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user filling out the laptop support form, I want to see real-time validation feedback as I interact with form fields, so that I can correct errors immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user leaves a field (blur event) AND the field has invalid data THEN the system SHALL display an error message below the field
2. WHEN the user starts typing in a field that has an error THEN the system SHALL clear the error message and styling
3. WHEN the user leaves a field (blur event) AND the field is valid THEN the system SHALL clear any existing error message
4. WHEN a field has validation errors THEN the system SHALL apply error styling (red border) to the field

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user filling out the laptop support form, I want to receive clear feedback about the form submission status, so that I know whether my request was successful or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form is being submitted THEN the system SHALL disable the submit button and show "Submitting..." text
2. WHEN the form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success toast notification
3. WHEN the form submission fails THEN the system SHALL show an error toast notification
4. WHEN the form submission completes (success or failure) THEN the system SHALL re-enable the submit button with original text
5. WHEN the form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL reset the form and clear all error states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user filling out the laptop support form, I want toast notifications to be dismissible and automatically disappear, so that they don't clutter the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a toast notification appears THEN the system SHALL include a close button (X) that allows manual dismissal
2. WHEN a toast notification appears THEN the system SHALL automatically dismiss it after 5 seconds
3. WHEN a new toast notification appears AND an existing toast is visible THEN the system SHALL remove the existing toast before showing the new one
4. WHEN a toast notification is dismissed THEN the system SHALL animate it sliding out to the right
