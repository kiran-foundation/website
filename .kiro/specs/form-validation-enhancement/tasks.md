  - Remove the custom `id="donate-now-button"` from the button
  - Remove unused Button import from Form.astro
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Validation utility implementation

  - Error message mappings for empty and invalid fields are complete
  - Field validators for all form fields are working correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Real-time validation functionality

  - Blur event validation is implemented for all form fields
  - Input event clears errors when user starts typing
  - Error styling (red borders) applies correctly to invalid fields
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Form submission flow implementation

  - Form prevents submission when validation fails
  - Submit button shows "Submitting..." state during submission
  - Form resets and clears errors after successful submission
  - Submit button re-enables after submission completes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 5. Toast notification system

  - Appropriate toast messages appear for different validation scenarios
  - Toast notifications auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

  - Only one toast appears at a time (new toasts replace existing ones)
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Focus and scroll behavior
  - First error field receives focus when validation fails
  - Page scrolls to bring the error field into view
