			<h3 class="editable">किरण प्रतिभा</h3>
			<p class="editable">In India every year many bright young kids have let their hopes and dreams go. They are forced by circumstances to battle harsh realities of life at the cost of their future. Many of them born into poor or uneducated families. Our aim through this program is to identify exceptional but underprivileged kids and support them in their endeavours of Education, Sports or Art according to their interest and abilities. </p>

			<h3 class="editable">किरण शक्ति</h3>
			<p class="editable">Confident and empowered women are essential for a strong and resilient society. Unfortunately, vitality of women as a catalyst for change is grossly underestimated in our society. Through this program we provide vocational and life skills trainings for women in their native language. We not only train them but also connect them to opportunities based on thier skills and constraints.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<div class="image">{% include icons/site.html icon="conditions" %}</div>
			<h3 class="editable">किरण ज्ञान</h3>
			<p class="editable">Right knowledge is most important tool for decision making. Ignorance is often not the absence of knowledge but absence of right knowledge. We regularly organized various free workshops. Our workshops are conducted by subject matter experts and are aimed to provide inspiration along with the information. We also provide one-on-one career counselling and guidence on the need basis.</p>

			<h3 class="editable">किरण सम्मान</h3>
			<p class="editable">India has about 80 million disabled people. They are never a factor in infrstructure, transportation etc. Not just small builders but many big real estate developer/builders close their eys towards disabled while building apartment complexes. This insensitivity makes India one of the worst countries for disabled. We are challenging this attitudes through disability sensitization and working on restoring the respect and equality for people with disability.</p>
