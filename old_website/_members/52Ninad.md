about: Hi Everybody! I am swayam jain I am from Chhindwara Madhya Pradesh.I joined KIRAN in 2020 I think which is the luckiest thing which I get where I don't only get a financial support as well as other comprehensive assistance which is far more than financial support I am not only a beneficiary but a true member of a KIRAN FOUNDATION. It will helpful for me lifelong.
