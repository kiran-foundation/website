about:  Jai jinendra. I have completed my 11th and 12th in science stream in GSS college Karnataka and I am an engineering aspirant. Till here my journey was not so easy, there are so many stones and struggles from which I have gone through. There are some situations where I had lost my all hope from life. Then I joined Kiran foundation which was a new part of my life. Where i met so many people who helps us like a teacher, supporter more then that they are so friendly with us.Kiran foundation not only helps us financially but also gives emotional strength to stand up again and again until we will achieve success. Foundation is the place which always tells me that "i deserves best in this life". I always enjoy being a family member of Kiran foundation.I wanted to learn more and more things from all the teachers, seniors and friends.
