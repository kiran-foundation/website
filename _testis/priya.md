The guidance and support extended by Kiran Foundation have proven to be immensely valuable and remarkably practical. I attended Essential Financial Skills and Everyday Law for Women courses. Both courses were well planned. The courses have increased my self confidence and I empowered me to take everyday decisions with clarity. Thank you so much for everything.
