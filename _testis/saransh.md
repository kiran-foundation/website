The Kiran Foundation feels like a family, apart from financial and emotional support I also receive mentorship, career guidance and advice on study planning. Kiran Foundation helps every capable student who wants to make a bright career. Members of Kiran Foundation also spend time with students to help handling different life situations.
Thank you.
