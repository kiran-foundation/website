        Ma Kiran Jain, born on October 17th, 1955, and departed from us on June
        15th, 2015, was not just a person, but a beacon of hope and resilience.
        Her words echoed a profound truth that resonates deeply within us: the
        failure of a society to nurture the dreams of its hardworking and
        talented youth is a failure of the society as a whole. Kiran Jain
        believed fervently that the progress of a society is intricately tied to
        the aspirations and achievements of its diligent and industrious
        members. She understood that when barriers such as lack of resources
        impede the realization of these dreams, it not only hampers individual
        potential but also casts a shadow over the collective advancement of
        society. Despite facing extreme hardships in her own life, Kiran Jain

        to circumstances beyond their control. In her vision, she saw the
        empowerment of every hardworking and talented youth as essential to
        steering society towards a path of progress and prosperity. From the
        seeds of her unwavering belief and vision, the Kiran Foundation was
        established. Inspired by her life and guided by her principles, the
        foundation endeavors to uplift and support those who, like Kiran Jain
        herself, confront obstacles on their journey to realizing their
        aspirations.
