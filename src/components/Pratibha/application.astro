          Since 2016, the Kiran Foundation has been committed to assisting
          talented students in their progress. Students from the Kiran
          Foundation family are currently touching new heights of success with
          their talent and dedication. Some others are diligently working with
          dedication and perseverance to build their future in their respective
          fields. <br /><br />Like in previous years, this year too, the Kiran
          Foundation will provide full support to talented and economically
          weaker students in their education, sports, or arts—whichever field
          aligns with their abilities and interests. Along with financial
          assistance, personal guidance and counseling will also be provided.
          The goal of the Kiran Foundation is to make these students successful
          and capable so that they not only improve their family's standard of
          living but also become a source of inspiration for society by
          utilizing their talents effectively.

          Assistance is available without consideration of the applicant's
          caste, community, gender, or religion. The sole eligibility criteria
          for assistance are verified qualifications, family income, and the
          student's desire to succeed.<br /><br />

          To determine the actual need and financial hardship faced by the
          student, the Kiran Foundation team collects documents and other
          evidence from the student and their family members.<br /><br />

          Please note that selection of all applicants may not be possible. All
          applicants agree to abide by the final decision of the Kiran
          Foundation.
