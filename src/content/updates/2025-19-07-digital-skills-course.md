    Digital safety and security were also key components of the training. Participants were guided on the safe and efficient use of social media, as well as the important skill of activating emergency SOS features on smartphones. To make daily life easier and more connected, they also practiced online shopping and order placement through major e-commerce platforms like Meesho and Amazon, along with several other practical digital tasks.
