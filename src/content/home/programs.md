'Kiran Pratibha' aims to identify exceptional yet underprivileged youth and support their endeavors in Education, Sports, or Art, aligned with their interests and abilities. The foundation provides active guidance, individualized mentoring, and full financial support to help them thrive."

  description: "Confident and empowered women are the foundation of a strong and resilient society. Yet, despite this acknowledgment, our society severely underestimates the vital role of women as catalysts for change. The 'Kiran Shakti' program addresses this by providing women with life skills and vocational training, offered in their native languages through tailored courses and workshops."
