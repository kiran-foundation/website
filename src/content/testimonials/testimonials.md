    text: The Advance Canva cource which I completed was very well planned, it exceeded our expectations. 
      The course  provided in-depth insights into advanced design techniques and features. The concise modules and practical exercises made learning a breeze. I now feel equipped to create professional designs with confidence. Trainers Shreya and Keshu were very clear in explaining the topic and helped us with the all our doubts. Highly recommended!
