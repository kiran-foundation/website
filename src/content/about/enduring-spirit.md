  In the memory of Kiran Ma, a foundation grew,<br />
  To uplift lives, her legacy, they pursue.<br /><br />

  With humble beginnings, a son's education secure,<br />
  Anurag's story, values profound, pure.<br /><br />

  Eight years since its start, a journey so grand,<br />
  Supporting dreams, across the land.<br /><br />

  Scholarships provided, a beacon of hope,<br />
  Mental support, helping each one cope.<br /><br />

  Monthly meetings, guidance and care,<br />
  Instilling belief, dreams to dare.<br /><br />

  Anurag, simplicity personified,<br />
  From his mother's grace, he derived.<br /><br />

  Though Kiran Ma's gone, her spirit endures,<br />
  Inspiring greatness, forever ensures.<br /><br />

  Nine years since she left, yet her light shines bright,<br />
  Kiran Foundation, spreading hope's - delight.<br /><br />
