      quote: "’I believe that legal awareness is a powerful tool for empowerment. Many women are unaware of the rights and protections available to them under the law, and that gap often leads to silence and injustice.
       Through Kiran Foundation’s ‘Law for Women’ course, we aim to bridge this gap by breaking down complex legal concepts into accessible and relatable knowledge. 
       Being associated with the Foundation since 2020 has given me the opportunity to mentor and learn from incredibly resilient women. Kiran Foundation’s grassroots approach to creating real change is what makes this initiative so close to my heart.’"
