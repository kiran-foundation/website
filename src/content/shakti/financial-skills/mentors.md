      quote: "I am driven by the belief that every woman has the power to shape her
          financial future. When women take charge of money matters, they not
          only strengthen themselves but uplift families and fuel the nation's
          growth. With the right guidance and confidence, no financial challenge
          is too big. Let’s break the silence around money and build a
          generation of financially fearless women."

      quote: "I have been associated with Kiran Foundation for the past two years,
          and it has been a deeply fulfilling journey. What excites me to teach
          selflessly is the initiative itself and, most importantly, the
          students at the foundation. Their curiosity, energy, and eagerness to
          learn continuously inspire me. Being part of this initiative not only
          allows me to give back but also brings a renewed sense of purpose and
          motivation to my own life."
