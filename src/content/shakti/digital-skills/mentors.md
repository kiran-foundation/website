      quote: "‘Every individual holds a spark of potential — waiting to be ignited through guidance, belief, and opportunity. Education is not just about learning facts, but about building confidence, character, and the courage to dream. When we uplift others, especially those who have been overlooked or unheard, we create ripples of change that reach far beyond the classroom. Empowerment begins when we stop seeing limitations and start nurturing possibilities. As a society, our true strength lies in how we support one another to rise, break barriers, and become the best versions of ourselves — together, we all grow stronger.’"

      quote: "‘We don’t just provide training, we spark transformation. For every woman who learns a new skill, there is a family that finds hope, a community that grows stronger, and a generation that becomes inspired to rise.’"
