heading : " Law For Women"
description: " Knowledge of laws and legal rights is essential for women to protect themselves from discrimination, abuse, and injustice. We empower women by providing them with the necessary information and resources to understand and assert their legal rights. Our program covers key legal frameworks and international conventions that safeguard women's rights, as well as laws and support services available to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment. Additionally, we educate women on their rights and options regarding marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance, enabling them to make informed decisions and take control of their lives."
