about: Hello Everyone! Jay Jinendra! My name is Shreya Jain and I'm from Garhakota (Sagar) M.P. I have completed my 10th and 12th from Garhakota and and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science from Shri G.S. Institute of Science and Technology. I joined KIRAN FOUNDATION as a student in 2018, since I joined, I have been truly amazed.
               Ever since I joined Kiran Foundation I have only one thing to say, that KIRAN FOUNDATION is not just an organization; it is a close-knit family. It not only extends financial assistance but also provides invaluable emotional support. I am immensely proud to be a part of this remarkable family, which has become my second home.
