about: Hello Everyone! My name is Shreya Jain and I'm from Garhakota (Sagar) M.P. I have completed my 10th and 12th from Garhakota and currently pursuing B.Tech from Shri G.S. Institute of Science and Technology in Computer Science.
                I have joined Kiran Foundation as a student in 2018. Ever since I joined Kiran Foundation I have only one thing to say, Kiran Foundation is not just a foundation, it is a family. It provides not only financial support but also mental support.
                 I can confidently say that it is my second family, and I am proud to be a part of this family.
