about: Hi everyone! I'm Yadava H C from Bengaluru, Karnataka. I have completed my 10th in MMVS School (97.12%) and 12th in kumarans College (95%). Currently, I'm joining engineering which was my dream as a child. I got information about Kiran foundation though Google and joined when I was studying 11th. It's not just a foundation, but a family with encouraging, inspiring people. Kiran foundation monthly meeting makes everyone connected and it feels like a family. I can proudly say that I'm the member of this beautiful family.
